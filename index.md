Hi, I am a PhD candidate in Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology
(Center for Nonlinear Science), working with Prof. Kurt Wiesenfeld. I am also collaborating with Prof. Jorge Laval in Civil & Environmental Engineering. Recently I have also begun collaborating with Prof. Sujin Babu and Prof. Ramakrishna Ramaswamy on problems in Active matter.

I’m working on **non-equilibrium statistical mechanics**, with a focus on  
**collective phenomena, scaling theory, and renormalization-group (RG) methods**.  
My work combines analytic approaches (path integrals, renormalization group) with large-scale simulations to understand emergent behavior in
driven many-body systems.

In parallel, through collaborations with transportation engineering groups, I have also  
**applied these methods to traffic models and real traffic data**, where the same tools
reveal scaling structure, and signatures of non-equilibrium
criticality.
